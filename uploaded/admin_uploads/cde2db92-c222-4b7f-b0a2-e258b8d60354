Digital Voting Transformation
NUS Chief Technology Officer Course
March 2024

Section I
Project Proposal / Problem Statement

1.     Identify a suitable organisation for the project (could be real or hypothetical).​
 
2.     ​Conduct a preliminary analysis of the organisation's current state, key challenges, and consumer pain points (if any). Examples: Outdated legacy systems, lack of data-driven insights, limited online presence, etc. ​
 
3.     ​Ascertain the problem statement(s) regarding the Digital Transformation Strategy (Write down specific problems that must be resolved to enhance technology and digital tool usage).


Business
Mid size business, 270 employees
Runs small to mid size votes for schools, universities, and home owner clubs.
Elections are administered using paper ballots after the candidates are chosen.
Votes are then counted manually under supervision.
Voting Systems Inc

Key Challenge: Trust
Verifiable
Each voter need to know that their individual vote is remembered and stored in the system and has not been changed.
Inspectable
Scalable
The system needs to be able to aggregate the votes
Computable
Many different voting styles need to be accounted for, first-past-the-post, preference.
Anonymity 
All voters need to be able to be able to hide their identity and their vote from the public.

Technology / Process
1. Contract and Planning
Customers reach out and engage the company
Projections about the size and complexity of the voting process must be made to properly estimate the cost of the managing the vote.
Plans are drawn up, permits are requested
2. Enrollment
Candidates/topics must be registered to be on the ballot.
Voters must enroll to be eligible to vote on the day.
Support staff must be available to handle enrollment difficulties.

3. Setup
Rosters for staffing are prepared. Admin work is required for scheduling, salaries, ordering materials.
Ballots are printed, checked and counted.
Polling stations are setup and placed.


3. Execution
Voters must physically travel to the polling locations, and often must remain in a queue to wait for their turn.
All voting is supervised and checked.


3. Counting 
Ballot boxes are moved 
Votes must be manually counted under strict supervision by a group of representatives, intended to create an impartial consensus.



Problems
1. Contract and Planning
Difficult and cumbersome for the client to properly estimate the size of the vote.
2. Enrollment
Slow and cumbersome to be enrolled.

3. Setup
Requires a lot of admin work and fabrication of single use materials.


3. Execution
Causes a lot of wasted time and uncomfortable situations
Voters are less likely to attend due to frictions


3. Counting 
Counting is slow, and despite honest intentions, mistakes still happen
Difficult for voters to truly trust the process



Problem Statement 
The process for creating a poll or election is too cumbersome that it restricts the frequency with with polls are held, resulting in a low resolution democracy.
The friction on voters to attend and cast their vote discourages engagement, resulting in a less representative democracy.
Despite the thoroughness of the people, mistakes still happen and trust can be low.

Project Proposal
Implement a blockchain based voting system that leverages ZK-SNARK algorithms to securely and anonymously collect votes, then aggregate them in a provable, inspectable way.

Section II
Digital Business Strategy

DBS
1.     Conduct a focused analysis of the organisation's environment, industry, market positioning, changing consumer preferences, and digital trends that could impact business.​
 
2.     Assess the organisation's digital readiness (current technological capabilities, digital infrastructure, and how it manages consumer data). Check how well it integrates with digital platforms. Identify areas that need improvement for a successful digital transformation.​
 
3.     Identify potential opportunities and untapped markets for your company. Specify the area and its details. Explain how you can provide value and the reasons behind your choice.​


Industry
DRE
Paper ballot
Lever Machines
Automation and digitisation increasing over time

The general public wants convenience, now more than ever before. Most people have become accustomed to ease and convenience.

Trust in voting and democracies is at an all time low. Introducing an element of opacity will only fuel these issues. Any solution must be above reproach.

Opportunities 
Government
Move Towards More Referendums
Small Communities
Governments already well established voting systems, however if a trustworthy and well built solution became available, it would be very interesting to many governments.

As the cost of running one of these elections decreased significantly and the effort spent on dealing with each client can be cut to nearly zero, a large number of smaller client's would suddenly come into scope for the business.
Similarly, as the effort required from the constituent public is dramatically decreased, the number of issue that individuals would be willing to vote on would increase.

Section III
Digital Transformation Strategy

DTS
1.     Examine the Digital Business Strategy (DBS). Find out how digital technologies create new value or enhance productivity. Describe how these changes affect consumers, operations, processes, and people.​
 
2.     Define strategic goals for digital transformation (include objectives inside and outside the company).​
 
3.     Make a clear plan. List important actions and rank them by impact and feasibility. Think about budget, tech use, and change in the organisation. Also, think about collaboration and scaling using a buy-build-borrow strategy.​


New Digital Technologies
A new mobile app for the business will allow users to be access the voting services more conveniently from the comfort of their own homes.
New Mobile App
With a new organised database, the company can gain better insights into how different demographics learn and respond to marketing. 
Organised Database
Operationally, the process of setting up a vote and delivering the outcome becomes significantly cheaper and faster when it can be done without physical polling booths and stationing staff onsite.
Digital Platform
Bringing in a cryptographic algorithm for anonymous, provable aggregation of users data will help to resolve the trust problem in the e-voting industry.
ZK-SNARK

ZK-SNARK
Highly innovative algorithm that unlocks huge potential.
Can be used to securely achieve the essential components of a good voting system
Any voter can check their vote has been counted, and is still stored in the database
Any voter can check their vote has not been changed
All voter information is kept anonymous from other voters
Any observer can check that the resulting numbers are a true and accurate sum of votes without knowing the source votes

This very intelligent algorithm is already in use in the crypto industry to prove that a custody provider (an exchange for example) does still hold all of the assets that users have deposited while preserving the privacy of all users.
